\title{Inverse Optimization Problem and Its Applications}
\author{\authors}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We present an improved algorithm for the \textit{inverse optimization problem} inspired from~\cite{keshavarz2011}, and lead more discussions on this approach together with its broad prospects and application areas. The original paper presents a number of good examples, after re-implementing the models, we refine the algorithm, discuss the performance and some factors that make the difference, and apply this approach to some more projects in the evaluation section.
